			<div class="blurb">Founded in 2008, the LUX Fashion Show, produced by Tufts China Care, exists to fundraise to provide orphaned children a loving and caring foster family through One Sky's Family Village Program. One Sky Foundation is an organization created to offer loving, family-like care to orphaned children of all ages and abilities in China. Through different model programs and caregiver training, One Sky is dedicated in ensuring that every orphaned child has a caring adult in his/her life and a chance at a bright future.</div>
			<div class="blurb">Tufts China Care is a student-run club at Tufts University and a recognized China Care club under One Sky. Through different events like LUX, Tufts China Care fundraises to provide these children with a warm and caring family. Last year, the show raised a total of $5,530 and sold out! Tufts China Care was able to donate $8,515.34 to One Sky, helping four children in the China Care Home. As the eighth annual LUX Fashion Show comes to an end, the LUX and China Care Executive Board are already eagerly planning for next year. So, mark your calendars down for the LUX Fashion Show in early April because this is an event you truly do not want to miss!</div>
